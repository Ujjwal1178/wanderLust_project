Hey guys,
This is my first fully functional full stack web application.
I have made this using node.js, express.js.
For front end part i have use ejs tampleting and for database i have use mongo atlas
This is a fully responsive website which is let user to get or rent their property.
User interface is very user friendly.
I have use MVC pattern, so my code will be easily understandable to others.
